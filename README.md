Stalfos
======================

Stalfos is a little front-end base project that'll help you put together a clean, modular codebase. It's designed not as a framework, but a helper and should let you extend it as you please. 

Out of the box it gives you:

- A SCSS based collection of helpers and a modular orientated project structure
- A JS / jQuery based project structure with some little helpers included 
- A [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) based HTML template building system 

The documentation for Stalfos lives at [stalfos.io](https://stalfos.io). 

## Getting Started 

1.  Download the [latest version of Stalfos](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/stalfos/archive/master.zip)
2.  Copy the contents of the extracted ZIP into your project file
3.  Open you terminal and `cd` to `{your project directory}/front-end/`
4.  Run `npm install`
5.  After NPM has finished installing the dependancies that Stalfos needs, run `gulp serve`. More info about the gulp commands can be found [here](https://stalfos.io#gulp-commands)
6.  Visit `http://localhost:8003` in your browser
7.  You should see your *almost* blank start page!

Now you've got yourself the basic kit running, let's delve into it a bit deeper with the [Stalfos Docs](https://stalfos.io).
